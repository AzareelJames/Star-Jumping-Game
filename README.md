    Even you past it you still lose. This is because of the hitbox.
    In the image when you look closer, you see the white background
    because I painted it with Microsoft Paint app.

    Make sure the page size was 100% or normal, because when you
    play the game but the page size is not 100%, you automatically
    lose.
